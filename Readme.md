OCR's 20 Code Challenges
==============

OCR produced a document with 20 coding challenges intended for GCSE students. It is included here.

In this repository I have included some of my examples of code to provide working solutions to these problems using Python. Please note that these are not intended to illustrate the best, the cleverest, or even remotely advanced methods of takling the challenge. In many cases the solutions are far from optimal.

As the challenges themselves are not really in any order of difficulty, some of the "easier" challenges (which may have a higher number) may have been tackled first and this may be before the students have covered more advanced techniques such as functions etc.

There is no OOP (Object Oriented Programming) in these examples as GCSE students are not expected to use OOP.

There are, of course, better ways to code solutions to these challenges. Moreover, I have largely (but not always) tried to avoid using Python specific code or libraries as these challenges are intended to be applicable no matter which language is being used (so there are often better ways of achieving the result using python tools and methods).

I have not provided solutions to all of the challenges. The reasonably complete versions are in the Master branch. There are others - which may be rough and untested in the Development branch, so look in there if the challenge you're looking for is not in the main branch.

Note also that there is often more than one version of a challenge. This may be to include some of the extension tasks, or it may be to illustrate a different method of accomplishing the task.

If you have any suggestions or improvements please do not hesitate to get in touch.
