OCR's 20 Code Challenges
==============

OCR produced a document with 20 coding challenges intended for GCSE students.

In this repository I have included some of my attempts to provided working solutions to these problems using Python. Please note that these are not intended to illustrate the best, the cleverest, or even remotely advanced methods of takling the challenge.
As the challenges themselves are not really in any order of difficulty, some of the "easier" challenges (which may have a higher number) may have been tackled first and this may be before the students have covered more advanced techniques such a functions etc.
There is no OOP (Object Oriented Programming) in these examples as GCSE students are not expected to use OOP.
There are, of course, better ways to code solutions to these challenges. Moreover, I have largely (but not always) tried to avoid using Python specific code or libraries as these challenges are intended to be applicable no matter which language is being used (so there are often better ways of achieving the result using python tools and methods).
