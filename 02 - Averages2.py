02 Averages
===========
Extension Version (No functions)

Â© Mark Sansome June 2018

Make a program that asks the user for a series of numbers until they either want
to output the average or quit the program.
Extensions:
1. Expand the program to print the median and mode averages also
2. Include options so that if the user wants to, they can save their list of numbers to a text file and read them back out later on.

This is a possible answer to Q2 on the OCR 20 Coding Challenges
with meadian, mode and average
(See Averages 3 for a version using functions)
